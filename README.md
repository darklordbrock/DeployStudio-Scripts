Scripts
=======

This script is a workflow selection script for DeployStudio. Essentially it contains every model name (Macbook6,1) out
there. The script pulls the model name and then determines from several arrays what the maximum operating system is
that the machine can run.

Then it will run the workflow that you designate for 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8. This needs to be modified with the correct
workflow keys before it will work.
